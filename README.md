- **Smooth animations** with beautiful face rotations
- **Move execution** with real-time algorithm tracking

### 🎮 **Simple Controls**

- **🔀 Scramble**: Generates proper dodecahedron scrambles (70 random moves)
- **✨ Solve**: Return to solved state instantly
- **📊 Move Counter**: Track total moves and current algorithm

### 🎨 **Modern Interface**

## 🎓 Learning and Extension

### **Easy to Extend**

Adding new features is straightforward with Twizzle:

```javascript
// Add solving algorithms
player.alg = "R U R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R'";

// Change puzzle type
player.puzzle = "3x3x3"; // or "4x4x4", "5x5x5", etc.

// Add different visualizations
player.visualization = "2D"; // or "3D", "experimental-2D-LL"
```
